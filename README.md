This folder contains the documents used and presented for a project I was on in 2023. The goal was to use the R programming language to visually represent our chosen topic of Femicide. Through research we decided to compare the economic, religious, and geographic factors. There is a research paper that outlines our process, figures, and findings. There is a presentation that summarizes our paper. Lastly included is the final code written in R.
